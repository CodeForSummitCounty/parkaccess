parkaccess
==========

New iteration of parkaccess, hosted on Heroku

Same project, new repo. You can see the app as in at park-access.herokuapp.com.

Purpose
=======

The purpose of this app is to visualize how accessible the parks and trails of Northeast Ohio currently are. Between Metro Parks Serving Summit County, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and Cleveland Metroparks, the region is absolutely blessed with parkland, with hundreds of thousands of acres actively preserved by these agencies.

However, not all citizens have equal access to those parks. It would be helpful to policy makers and citizens to understand how accessible existing parks and trails are. 

Eventually, we'd like to measure access to parks and trails via public transit and bicycle, but for now we are starting with access on foot. Specifically, we're interested in how many people live withing a .5 mile "walkshed" of a park or trail.

We're using Census Blocks to query the total population--and the demographics of that population--within that walkshed.
